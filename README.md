# Memory Pair Game with Unity and C#

In this project we are going to create a basic game to discover the all possible pair create in a grid.
For this purpose we are goin to use OOP and Components of Unity.
In the first hand we will use tree clasess initially, considering the basic functionality. These clasess will be CardManager, GridManager and the main class GameManager.
We will learn how to use an empty object as a reference for a component, I mean the GridManager.
We will be able to create comunication between objects using the GameManager which will works with the main functionality and will be a medium between the cards and other objects that will be created in the future.
We will use List<> of C# to load manually sprites and distribute them in the scene. Most of these values will be loaded using a matrix as datasource of images(Sprites)
Also we will use a List of Componentes, specifically the CardManager Component, that has the main atributes that we will need to manipulete, I mean, swaping, clonning, etc.
So let's dive in


## Initial Class Diagram

We will work on the base of:

Those marked with red are implemente in first hand, and the other ones will be implemented by yourself guided with a tutorial
